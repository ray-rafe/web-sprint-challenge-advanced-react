Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

Functional components do not hold state, they display what is passed through props while stateful components can hold state.

componentWillMount is called when the render method is called and componentWillUpdate is called before rendering the component.
